## Want to try it youself?

The app runs on top of Python + Flask. To run it locally with your own account, follow the next few steps:

### 1) Fork the repo üëÜ

You will need to set up your own Twitter API keys and accounts name. As you don't have write permissions on this repo, you will need to fork it into your own account.

### 2) Configure your Twitter API keys

In order to use the Twitter API to fetch account followers, you will need to authenticate yourself using your app's access key and token.

You don't have a Twitter API key yet? Start by checking https://apps.twitter.com/.

Once you have it, go to `app.py` file and change them accordingly: https://github.com/martinzugnoni/shared-twitter-friends/blob/master/app.py#L13-L16

### 3) List your friends' accounts

By default, the app is configured to use my personal friends' account. You will probably want to use yours.

You just need to replace these lines with your friends' Twitter usernames.

### 4) Run the app

Once of the best things about Flask, is its simplicity for writing and running a web app.

All you need to do is running `python app.py` in your preferred terminal, and visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

That's all! üôå
